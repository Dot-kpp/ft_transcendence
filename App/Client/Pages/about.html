        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <div class="about-project">
            <p class="text-box"> Welcome to "Transcendence," a cutting-edge project developed by the students of 42 School.
                This innovative endeavor represents a convergence of technology, creativity, and problem-solving,
                showcasing the prowess of our students in pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
            </p>
            <h3>The Goal:</h3>
            <p class="text-box">
                The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, multiplayer game of pong
                <br />

                yes..
                <br />
                pong.. 
                <br />
                <br />

                But! With over engineered
                features.
                <br />
                <br />

                - The game must be playable in different modes, such as play against another player and create your very
                own tournament.
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can match up with fellow pong enthusiasts and play against them.
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can host your own tournament and invite your friends to play.
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can maybe idk if my team wants to implement a chat? do we have to?
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can also play against a bot, but that's not as fun.
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can also play another player locally like you sister who probably sucks at this game so get on that.
                <br />
                <br />
                - You can log in and it becomes a whole thing.
                <br />
                <br />
            <h3>Complexity and Decision-Making:</h3>
            <p class="text-box">
                Transcendence is a multifaceted project that demands thoughtful decision-making within defined
                constraints. Participants are encouraged to navigate the complexities of the project,
                making informed choices that align with the specified parameters.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexibility and Justifiability:</h3>
            <p class="text-box">
                While there is flexibility in implementing certain modules, participants are reminded
                to exercise discretion within the project's scope. Every choice made must be justifiable,
                prompting a critical evaluation of whether a specific tool or technology is truly necessary
                for the successful completion of the project.

                        In the grand symphony of 42 Quebec, Jeremie is the conductor of laughter, orchestrating comedic
                        notes that resonate through the corridors of algorithms and lines of code. His humor is like a
                        debugging tool – it not only finds and fixes glitches but adds an element of joy to the entire
                        programming process.

                        When it comes to describing friends on a website, Jeremie transforms the mundane into a comedy
                        show. Expect a bio that's more entertaining than a sitcom, where his friends become characters
                        in a hilarious code-driven narrative. Imagine an array of anecdotes, each line of description a
                        punchline that leaves you smiling, and possibly snorting, as you read.
                        <br />

                        In the world of friendship websites, Jeremie's touch is like a software update – refreshing,
                        unexpected, and guaranteed to make your day a little brighter. So, buckle up for a journey into
                        the whimsical realm of Jeremie's friendship, where every line of code comes with a side of

                        Clement is like a fine wheel of aged Gouda, a friend whose presence matures and enriches the
                        flavors of life. Just as Gouda is known for its smooth and creamy texture, Clement brings a
                        comforting and soothing presence to any situation. His warmth is akin to the gentle notes of
                        caramel in the cheese, creating a bond that's both sweet and enduring.

                        pairs well with various accompaniments, Clement complements the diverse aspects of your life,
