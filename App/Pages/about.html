        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <div class="about-project">
            <p>  Welcome to "Transcendence," a cutting-edge project developed by the students of 42 School.
                This innovative endeavor represents a convergence of technology, creativity, and problem-solving, 
                 showcasing the prowess of our students in pushing the boundaries of what is possible.    
                </p>
                <h3>The Goal:</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, multiplayer game of pong with over engineered features. 
                    The game must be playable in different modes, such as play against another player and create your very own tournament. 
                <h3>Complexity and Decision-Making:</h3>
                <p>
                    Transcendence is a multifaceted project that demands thoughtful decision-making within defined 
                constraints. Participants are encouraged to navigate the complexities of the project, 
                making informed choices that align with the specified parameters.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexibility and Justifiability:</h3>
            <p>
                While there is flexibility in implementing certain modules, participants are reminded 
                to exercise discretion within the project's scope. Every choice made must be justifiable, 
                prompting a critical evaluation of whether a specific tool or technology is truly necessary 
                for the successful completion of the project.
